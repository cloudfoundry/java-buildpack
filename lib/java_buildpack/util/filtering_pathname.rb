    # This class conforms to the interface of +Pathname+, but filters the set of files that can be accessed and does not
    # support +Pathname+'s class methods. This class also provides a +glob+ instance method which filters its output.
    #
    # If a +Pathname+ method which mutates the file system is called, it will throw an exception unless the instance is
    # created as mutable.
    #
    # If the underlying filesystem is modified once an instance of this path has been created, the view provided
    # by the instance will not change unless a file or directory allowed by the instance's filter is created, modified,
    # or deleted.
    class FilteringPathname

      # Create a +FilteringPathname+ which behaves like the given pathname, but which applies the given filter to all
      # files.
      #
      # The filesystem underpinning the given pathname must not contain a file or directory whose name is the name of
      # the given pathname with '.nil' appended to it. This must be true for the lifetime of the +FilteringPathname+.
      #
      # The filter is applied to files which are accessed via the given pathname.
      # If the filter returns +true+ for a particular pathname, the pathname behaves normally for this instance.
      # If the filter returns +false+ for a particular pathname, the pathname behaves as if it does not exist.
      #
      # Note that the filter must obey the following rule: if the filter accepts Pathnames p and r, where p is a parent
      # directory of r, then the filter must accept every Pathname q where p is a parent directory of q and q is a
      # parent directory of r. FilteringPathname does not check that the filter obeys this rule.
      #
      # The +FilteringPathname+ may be immutable in which case calling a mutator method causes an exception to be
      # thrown. Alternatively, the +FilteringPathname+ may be mutable in which case calling a mutator method may mutate
      # the file system. The results of mutating the file system will be subject to filtering by the given filter.
      #
      # @param [Pathname] pathname the +Pathname+ which is to be filtered
      # @param [Proc] filter a lambda which takes a +Pathname+ and returns either +true+ (to 'keep' the pathname) or
      #         +false+ (to filter out the pathname).  Defaults to keeping everything
      # @param [Boolean] mutable +true+ if and only if the +FilteringPathname+ may be used to mutate the file system
