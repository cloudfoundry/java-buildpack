# A mixin that adds the ability to format a +Numeric+ as a user-readable duration

  #                   1. If more than an hour, print hours and minutes
  #                   2. If less than an hour and more than a minute, print minutes and seconds
  #                   3. If less than a minute and more than a second, print seconds.tenths
