# Cloud Foundry Java Buildpack

The `java-buildpack` is a [Cloud Foundry][] buildpack for running JVM-based applications. It is designed to run many JVM-based applications ([Grails][], [Groovy][], Java Main, [Play Framework][], [Spring Boot][], and Servlet) with no additional configuration, but supports configuration of the standard components, and extension to add custom components.

## Usage
To use this buildpack specify the URI of the repository when pushing an application to Cloud Foundry:

```bash
$ cf push <APP-NAME> -p <ARTIFACT> -b https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack.git
```

## Examples
The following are _very_ simple examples for deploying the artifact types that we support.

* [Embedded web server](docs/example-embedded-web-server.md)
* [Grails](docs/example-grails.md)
* [Groovy](docs/example-groovy.md)
* [Java Main](docs/example-java_main.md)
* [Play Framework](docs/example-play_framework.md)
* [Servlet](docs/example-servlet.md)
* [Spring Boot CLI](docs/example-spring_boot_cli.md)

## Configuration and Extension

The buildpack default configuration can be overridden with an environment variable matching the configuration file you wish to override minus the `.yml` extension. It is not possible to add new configuration properties and properties with `nil` or empty values will be ignored by the buildpack (in this case you will have to extend the buildpack, see below). The value of the variable should be valid inline yaml, referred to as "flow style" in the yaml spec ([Wikipedia][] has a good description of this yaml syntax).

There are two levels of overrides: operator and application developer.

  - If you are an operator that wishes to override configuration across a foundation, you may do this by setting environment variable group entries that begin with a prefix of `JBP_DEFAULT`.
  - If you are an application developer that wishes to override configuration for an individual application, you may do this by setting environment variables that begin with a prefix of `JBP_CONFIG`. 

Here are some examples:

### Operator

1. To change the default version of Java to 11 across all applications on a foundation.

```bash
$ cf set-staging-environment-variable-group '{"JBP_DEFAULT_OPEN_JDK_JRE":"{jre: {version: 11.+ }}"}'
```

2. To change the default repository root across all applications on a foundation. Be careful to ensure that your JSON is properly escaped.

```bash
$ cf set-staging-environment-variable-group '{"JBP_DEFAULT_REPOSITORY": "{default_repository_root: \"http://repo.example.io\" }"}'
```

3. To change the default JVM vendor across all applications on a foundation. Be careful to ensure that your JSON is properly escaped.

```bash
$ cf set-staging-environment-variable-group '{"JBP_DEFAULT_COMPONENTS": "{jres: [\"JavaBuildpack::Jre::ZuluJRE\"]}"}'
```

### Application Developer

1. To change the default version of Java to 11 and adjust the memory heuristics then apply this environment variable to the application.

```bash
$ cf set-env my-application JBP_CONFIG_OPEN_JDK_JRE '{ jre: { version: 11.+ }, memory_calculator: { stack_threads: 25 } }'
```

2. If the key or value contains a special character such as `:` it should be escaped with double quotes. For example, to change the default repository path for the buildpack.

```bash
$ cf set-env my-application JBP_CONFIG_REPOSITORY '{ default_repository_root: "http://repo.example.io" }'
```

3. If the key or value contains an environment variable that you want to bind at runtime you need to escape it from your shell. For example, to add command line arguments containing an environment variable to a [Java Main](docs/container-java_main.md) application.

```bash
$ cf set-env my-application JBP_CONFIG_JAVA_MAIN '{ arguments: "--server.port=9090 --foo=bar" }'
```

4. An example of configuration is to specify a `javaagent` that is packaged within an application.

```bash
$ cf set-env my-application JAVA_OPTS '-javaagent:app/META-INF/myagent.jar -Dmyagent.config_file=app/META-INF/my_agent.conf'
```

5. Environment variable can also be specified in the applications `manifest` file. For example, to specify an environment variable in an applications manifest file that disables Auto-reconfiguration.

```bash
env:
  JBP_CONFIG_SPRING_AUTO_RECONFIGURATION: '{ enabled: false }'
```

6. This final example shows how to change the version of Tomcat that is used by the buildpack with an environment variable specified in the applications manifest file.

```bash
env:
  JBP_CONFIG_TOMCAT: '{ tomcat: { version: 8.0.+ } }'
```

See the [Environment Variables][] documentation for more information.

The buildpack supports extension through the use of Git repository forking. The easiest way to accomplish this is to use [GitHub's forking functionality][] to create a copy of this repository. Make the required extension changes in the copy of the repository. Then specify the URL of the new repository when pushing Cloud Foundry applications. If the modifications are generally applicable to the Cloud Foundry community, please submit a [pull request][] with the changes. More information on extending the buildpack is available [here](docs/extending.md).

## Building Packages
The buildpack can be packaged up so that it can be uploaded to Cloud Foundry using the `cf create-buildpack` and `cf update-buildpack` commands. In order to create these packages, the rake `package` task is used.

Note that this process is not currently supported on Windows. It is possible it will work, but it is not tested, and no additional functionality has been added to make it work.

### Online Package
The online package is a version of the buildpack that is as minimal as possible and is configured to connect to the network for all dependencies. This package is about 250K in size. To create the online package, run:

```bash
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec rake clean package
...
Creating build/java-buildpack-cfd6b17.zip
```

### Offline Package
The offline package is a version of the buildpack designed to run without access to a network. It packages the latest version of each dependency (as configured in the [`config/` directory][]) and [disables `remote_downloads`][]. To create the offline package, use the `OFFLINE=true` argument:

To pin the version of dependencies used by the buildpack to the ones currently resolvable use the `PINNED=true` argument. This will update the [`config/` directory][] to contain exact version of each dependency instead of version ranges.
```bash
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec rake clean package OFFLINE=true PINNED=true
...
Creating build/java-buildpack-offline-cfd6b17.zip
```

If you would rather specify the exact version to which the buildpack should bundle, you may manually edit the [`config/` file](`config/`) for the component and indicate the specific version to use. For most components, there is a single `version` property which defaults to a pattern to match the latest version. By setting the `version` property to a fixed version, the buildpack will install that exact version when you run the package command. For JRE config files, like [`config/open_jdk_jre.yml`](config/open_jdk_jre.yml), you need to set the `version_lines` array to include the specific version you'd like to install. By default, the `version_lines` array is going to have a pattern entry for each major version line that matches to the latest patch version. You can override the items in the `version_lines` array to set a specific versions to use when packaging the buildpack. For a JRE, the `jre.version` property is used to set the default version line and must match one of the entries in the `version_lines` property.

This package size will vary depending on what dependencies are included. You can reduce the size by removing unused components, because only packages referenced in the [`config/components.yml` file](config/components.yml) will be cached. In addition, you can remove entries from the `version_lines` array in JRE configuration files, this removes that JRE version line, to further reduce the file size. 

Additional packages may be added using the `ADD_TO_CACHE` argument. The value of `ADD_TO_CACHE` should be set to the name of a `.yml` file in the [`config/` directory][] with the `.yml` file extension omitted (e.g. `sap_machine_jre`). Multiple file names may be separated by commas. This is useful to add additional JREs. These additional components will not be enabled by default and must be explicitly enabled in the application with the `JBP_CONFIG_COMPONENTS` environment variable.

```bash
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec rake clean package OFFLINE=true ADD_TO_CACHE=sap_machine_jre,ibm_jre
...
Caching https://public.dhe.ibm.com/ibmdl/export/pub/systems/cloud/runtimes/java/8.0.6.26/linux/x86_64/ibm-java-jre-8.0-6.26-x86_64-archive.bin
Caching https://github.com/SAP/SapMachine/releases/download/sapmachine-11.0.10/sapmachine-jre-11.0.10_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz
...
Creating build/java-buildpack-offline-cfd6b17.zip
```

### Package Versioning
Keeping track of different versions of the buildpack can be difficult. To help with this, the rake `package` task puts a version discriminator in the name of the created package file. The default value for this discriminator is the current Git hash (e.g. `cfd6b17`). To change the version when creating a package, use the `VERSION=<VERSION>` argument:

```bash
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec rake clean package VERSION=2.1
...
Creating build/java-buildpack-2.1.zip
```

### Packaging Caveats

1. Prior to version 4.51 when pinning versions, only the default JRE version is pinned. There is [special handling to package additional versions of a JRE](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack/blob/main/rakelib/dependency_cache_task.rb#L128-L144) and the way this works, it will pick the latest version at the time you package not at the time of the version's release. Starting with version 4.51, the version number for all JRE version lines is tracked in the `config/` file.

2. The `index.yml` file for a dependency is packaged in the buildpack cache when building offline buildpacks. The `index.yml` file isn't versioned with the release, so if you package an offline buildpack later after the release was tagged, it will pull the current `index.yml`, not the one from the time of the release. This can result in errors at build time if a user tells the buildpack to install the latest version of a dependency because the latest version is calculated from the `index.yml` file which has more recent versions than what are packaged in the offline buildpack. For example, if the user says give me Java `11._+` and the buildpack is pinned to Java `11.0.13_8` but at the time you packaged the buildpack the latest version in `index.yml` is `11.0.15_10` then the user will get an error. The buildpack will want to install `11.0.15_10` but it won't be present because `11.0.13_8` is all that's in the buildpack.

    Because of #1 for versions prior to 4.51, this only impacts the default JRE. Non-default JREs always package the most recent version, which is also the most recent version in `index.yml` at the time you package the offline buildpack. For 4.51 and up, this can impact all versions.

4. Because of #1 and #2, it is not possible to accurately reproduce packages of the buildpack, after releases have been cut. If building pinned or offline buildpacks, it is suggested to build them as soon as possible after a release is cut and save the produced artifact. Alternatively, you would need to maintain your own buildpack dependency repository and keep snapshots of the buildpack dependency repository for each buildpack release you'd like to be able to rebuild.
