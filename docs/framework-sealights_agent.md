# Sealights Agent Framework
The Sealights Agent Framework causes an application to be automatically configured to work with [Sealights Service][].

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Detection Criterion</strong></td><td>Existence of a single bound sealights service. The existence of a sealights service defined by the <a href="http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/environment-variable.html#VCAP-SERVICES"><code>VCAP_SERVICES</code></a> payload containing a service name, label or tag with <code>sealights</code> as a substring.
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Tags</strong></td><td><tt>sealights-agent=&lt;version&gt;</tt></td>
  </tr>
</table>
Tags are printed to standard output by the buildpack detect script

## User-Provided Service
When binding Sealights using a user-provided service, it must have name or tag with `sealights` in it.
The credential payload can contain the following entries. 

| Name             | Description
|------------------| -----------
| `token`          | A Sealights Agent token
| `proxy`          | Specify a HTTP proxy used to communicate with the Sealights backend. Required when a corporate network prohibits communication to cloud services. The default is to have no proxy configured. This does not inherit from `http_proxy`/`https_proxy` or `http.proxyHost/https.proxyHost`, you must set this specifically if a proxy is needed.
| `lab_id`         | Specify a Sealights [Lab ID][]
| `customAgentUrl` | Specify an url to download zip containing custom Sealights agent jar. If the custom agent is downloaded then the 'enable_upgrade' is forced to 'false'

All fields above except the agent token may be also specified in the [Configuration Section](#configuration) below.

## Configuration
For general information on configuring the buildpack, including how to specify configuration values through environment variables, refer to [Configuration and Extension][].

The framework can be configured by modifying the [`config/sealights_agent.yml`][] file. The framework uses the [`Repository` utility support][repositories] and so it supports the [version syntax][] defined there.

| Name | Description
| ---- | -----------
| `build_session_id` | Sealights [Build Session ID][] for the application. Leave blank to use the value embedded in the jar/war artifacts
| `proxy` | Specify a HTTP proxy used to communicate with the Sealights backend. Required when a corporate network prohibits communication to cloud services. The default is to have no proxy configured. This does not inherit from `http_proxy`/`https_proxy` or `http.proxyHost/https.proxyHost`, you must set this specifically if a proxy is needed.
| `lab_id` | Specify a Sealights [Lab ID][]
| `enable_upgrade` | Enable/disable agent auto-upgrade. Off by default
| `version` | The version of Auto-reconfiguration to use. Candidate versions can be found in [this listing][]. If auto_upgrade is turned on, a different version may be downloaded and used at runtime
| `customAgentUrl` | Specify an url to download zip containing custom Sealights agent jar. If the custom agent is downloaded then the 'enable_upgrade' is forced to 'false'

Configuration settings will take precedence over the ones specified in the [User-Provided Service](#user-provided-service), if those are defined.
